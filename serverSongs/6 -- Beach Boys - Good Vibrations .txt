I, I love the colorful clothes she wears
And on the way this sunlight plays upon her hair
I hear the sound of a gentle word
On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me the excitations
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
(Oom bop bop good vibrations)
(Oom bop bop excitations)
She's giving me the excitations
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
(Good good good good vibrations)
She's giving me the excitations
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
(Good good good good vibrations)
She's giving me the excitations
Close my eyes, she's somehow closer now
Softly smile, I know she must be kind
When I look in her eyes
She goes with me to a blossom world
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me the excitations
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
(Oom bop bop good vibrations)
(Oom bop bop excitations)
She's giving me the excitations
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
(Good good good good vibrations)
(Oom bop bop excitations)
She's giving me the excitations
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
(Good good good good vibrations)
She's giving me the excitations
(Elation)
I don't know where but she sends me there
(My my what a sensation)
(My my what elations)
(Ah my my what)
