What you want, baby, I got it
What's you need? You know I got it
All I'm askin' is for a little respect when you get home
Hey baby, when you get home, mister
I ain't gonna do you wrong while you're gone
I ain't gonna do you wrong because I don't wanna
All I'm askin' is for a little respect when you get home
Hey baby, when you get home, listen
I'm about to give all of my money
And all I'm askin' in return, honey
You give me my profits when you get there
Yeah baby, when you get home, oh, yeah, ooh
Your kiss is sweeter than honey
Guess what? So here's my money
All I need is just a little respect when you get home
Baby, when you get home
[Incomprehensible] on me
R E S P E C T
Find out what it means to me
R E S P E C T
Take care, T C B
Oh, a little respect
Yeah, baby, I want a little respect
Now, I get tired, but I keep on tryin'
Runnin' out of foolin', I ain't lyin'
Yes, respect, all I need is respect
All I want, ooh yeah, I want little respect
Yeah, baby, a little respect
Oh honey, sock it to me
Ooh, I want a little respect
