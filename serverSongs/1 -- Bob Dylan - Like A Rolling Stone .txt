Once upon a time you dressed so fine
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People'd call, say, "Beware doll, you're bound to fall"
You thought they were all kiddin' you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin' out
Now, you don't talk so loud, now, you don't seem so proud
About havin' to be scrounging around for your next meal
How does it feel, how does it feel?
To be without a home
With no direction home, like a complete unknown
Just like a rolling stone?
You've gone to the finest school all right, Miss. Lonely
But you know you only used to get juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
And you find out now you're gonna have to get used to it
You said you'd never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not sellin' any alibis, as you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say, " Would you like to make a deal?"
How does it feel, how does it feel?
To be without a home
With no direction home, like a complete unknown
Just like a rolling stone?
You never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns
When they all came down to do tricks for you
You never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
Used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that he really wasn't where it's at
After he's taken everything he could steal
How does it feel, how does it feel?
To be without a home
With no direction home, like a complete unknown
Just like a rolling stone?
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchanging all precious gifts and things
But you'd better take your diamond ring, down and pawn it, babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose
You're invisible, you got no secrets to conceal
How does it feel, how does it feel?
To be without a home
With no direction home, like a complete unknown
Just like a rolling stone?
